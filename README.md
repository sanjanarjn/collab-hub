# collab-hub
Collab-Hub is an iOS app designed to simplify the open-source journey for beginners. This repository contains the source code for the backend APIs.

It empowers users to customize their exploration by selecting:
- Interest Area: Choose from various domains like science, commerce, etc.
- Technical Focus: Define your preferred area, such as backend, frontend, mobile, web, etc.
- Technology Stack: Specify your preferred programming languages and frameworks.
  
Utilizing the GitHub Search REST API, the app performs intelligent matching, providing users with tailored suggestions of GitHub repositories and beginner-friendly issues. 

## Challenges Addressed:
The primary challenge CollabHub aims to resolve is the difficulty newcomers face in identifying suitable projects and issues aligned with their skills and interests. The open-source community on GitHub is dynamic, with new projects and issues constantly emerging. Understanding GitHub's search syntax can be complex for beginners. CollabHub steps in to abstract this complexity and provide a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features:
### User Persona Creation:
Users begin their journey with CollabHub by creating a personalized profile. This profile captures essential details, such as their domain of interest (e.g., science, commerce), their technical focus area (e.g., backend, frontend, mobile, web development), and their preferred programming languages and frameworks. These preferences serve as the foundation for tailored recommendations.

### Issue Matching:
CollabHub leverages the powerful GitHub Search REST API to match user preferences with repositories and issues. This intelligent matching system ensures that users are presented with projects and issues that align with their expertise and interests. The app continually refines these recommendations, adapting to the user's evolving skills and preferences.

### GitHub App Integration:
From the project creator's perspective, CollabHub can be extended to the creation of a GitHub app that can be installed from the GitHub Marketplace. This app simplifies collaboration by facilitating communication between project owners and potential contributors. When a relevant issue is created within a repository that the GitHub app has access to, issue events are sent to the GitHub app. The app then notifies contributors whose preferences align with the issue, streamlining the process of finding help for projects and issues.
